# UHRR Mobile Audio Streaming Fix

This directory contains the fixes for the mobile audio streaming issues in Universal HamRadio Remote (UHRR).

## Problem
The mobile interface was experiencing audio streaming issues with:
- No audio reception on mobile devices
- No audio transmission when pressing PTT
- Extremely high bandwidth usage (700kbps instead of 16-64kbps)

## Solution
The issues were resolved through several key fixes:

1. **Opus Decoder Compatibility**: Fixed Python 3.12 compatibility issue in `/opus/api/decoder.py`
2. **Mobile Device Detection**: Enhanced detection for iPhone 15 and modern devices
3. **Audio Initialization**: Improved timing and error handling for audio connections
4. **WebSocket Management**: Added proper connection state checking
5. **Debugging Tools**: Added test functions and verification scripts

## Key Files

- `FINAL_AUDIO_FIX_REPORT.md` - Complete solution documentation
- `MOBILE_AUDIO_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - Summary of changes made
- `final_audio_verification.py` - Verification script to check all components
- `test_audio_fix.py` - Test script for audio WebSocket connections

## Testing

Run the verification script to check if all components are properly configured:
```bash
python3 final_audio_verification.py
```

To test the audio streaming:
1. Start the UHRR server: `./UHRR`
2. Open the mobile interface in a browser
3. Connect to the radio using the power button
4. Check that RX status becomes active
5. Test TX by pressing the PTT button
6. Use the 'Test Audio' button if issues occur

## Expected Results

- Audio should stream correctly with reduced bandwidth (16-64kbps)
- Mobile devices should be properly detected
- PTT functionality should work correctly
- Status indicators should accurately reflect connection state
