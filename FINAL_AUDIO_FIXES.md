# Final Audio Streaming Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Python 3.12 Compatibility Issue with Opus Codec
- The Opus decoder was using deprecated `.tostring()` method which was removed in Python 3.12
- This caused `AttributeError: 'array.array' object has no attribute 'tostring'` when transmitting audio

### 2. Incomplete Fix in Opus Encoder
- While the decoder.py file was correctly updated to use `.tobytes()`, the encoder.py file still had `.tostring()` calls
- This could cause similar issues during audio encoding

### 3. Sample Rate Compatibility Issues
- Sample rate mismatch between old browser interface (expecting 8000 Hz) and updated code (using 24000 Hz)
- Causing audio playback failures in older browsers

### 4. Log Flooding Issue
- The audio interface was printing "Using right channel only" for every single audio frame
- This was flooding the logs and potentially causing performance issues

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Opus Decoder (already done in previous fix)
- File: `/Users/cheenle/UHRR/UHRR_mac/opus/api/decoder.py`
- Lines 150 and 170: Changed `.tostring()` to `.tobytes()`

### 2. Fixed Opus Encoder (new fix)
- File: `/Users/cheenle/UHRR/UHRR_mac/opus/api/encoder.py`
- Lines 81 and 99: Changed `.tostring()` to `.tobytes()`

### 3. Updated Sample Rates for Browser Compatibility
- File: `/Users/cheenle/UHRR/UHRR_mac/www/mobile.js`
- Changed `audioRXSampleRate` from 24000 to 8000
- Updated filter frequency from 22000 to 4000 Hz to match 8kHz sample rate

- File: `/Users/cheenle/UHRR/UHRR_mac/www/mobile_audio_direct_copy.js`
- Changed `AudioRX_sampleRate` from 24000 to 8000
- Updated `OpusEncoderProcessor.sampleRate` from 24000 to 8000
- Updated `OpusEncoderProcessor.frameSize` from 960 to 160 (20ms at 8kHz)
- Updated filter frequency from 12000 to 4000 Hz to match 8kHz sample rate

### 4. Reduced Log Flooding
- File: `/Users/cheenle/UHRR/UHRR_mac/audio_interface.py`
- Modified code to only print channel usage messages once every 1000 frames instead of every frame
- Changed `input_channel` and `output_channel` configuration from `2` to `auto` in `UHRR.conf`

## Verification

- Created and ran test scripts to verify both decoder and encoder functionality
- Confirmed all Opus encoding/decoding tests pass
- Verified server starts without errors
- Audio streaming should now work correctly on both desktop and mobile interfaces

## Expected Results

- No more `AttributeError: 'array.array' object has no attribute 'tostring'` errors
- Audio encoding and decoding should work correctly with Opus codec
- Bandwidth optimization through Opus encoding should function as expected (16-64kbps vs 700kbps previously)
- Audio streaming should work on both desktop (`/www/index.html`) and mobile (`/mobile`) interfaces
- Significantly reduced log volume while still providing debugging information
- Automatic channel configuration instead of forcing right channel only
