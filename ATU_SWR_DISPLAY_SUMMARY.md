# ATU SWR Display Verification Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the verification of the ATU (Automatic Tuning Unit) SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) display functionality in the UHRR system.

## Components Verified

### 1. Backend (ATU Client)
- ✅ ATU client successfully connects to the ATR-1000 device
- ✅ Both power and SWR data are retrieved from the ATU
- ✅ Data is properly formatted and sent via WebSocket to the frontend

### 2. WebSocket Communication
- ✅ ATU data is transmitted through the WebSocket connection
- ✅ Data format: `getATUData:power=XX.X,swr=YY.YY`
- ✅ Both power and SWR values are parsed correctly

### 3. Frontend Display
- ✅ HTML elements for SWR display are properly defined:
  - `<meter id="atuSwrMeter">` for the SWR meter visualization
  - `<div id="atuSwrValue">` for the numeric SWR value display
- ✅ CSS styling is correctly applied to SWR elements
- ✅ updateATUDisplay() function properly handles SWR values:
  - Updates the meter value with `atuSwrMeter.value = swr`
  - Updates the text display with `atuSwrValue.textContent = swr.toFixed(2)`
  - Applies value limiting to keep SWR within meter range (0-3)

### 4. Data Flow
1. ATU client retrieves power and SWR data from ATR-1000
2. Data is sent via WebSocket to the browser
3. Frontend JavaScript parses the data
4. updateATUDisplay() function updates both power and SWR displays
5. Users can see real-time SWR values in the interface

## Test Results
- ✅ Power display working correctly
- ✅ SWR display working correctly
- ✅ Both values update in real-time
- ✅ Value limiting prevents meter overflow
- ✅ Proper formatting (1 decimal for power, 2 decimals for SWR)

## Issues Resolved
- Removed duplicate updateATUDisplay functions that could cause conflicts
- Verified all element IDs match between HTML and JavaScript
- Confirmed CSS styling is properly applied
- Verified correct data parsing in JavaScript

## Conclusion
The ATU SWR display is fully functional and working as expected. Both power and SWR values are correctly retrieved from the ATR-1000 device and displayed in the user interface.

Users can now monitor their antenna tuner's SWR in real-time alongside power measurements, providing valuable feedback for antenna tuning and system performance monitoring.
